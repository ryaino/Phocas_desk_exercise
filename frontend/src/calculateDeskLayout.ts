/**
 * requirements teams must sit together.
 * People who don't like dogs should be placed as far away from those who have dogs as possible.
 * People who have dogs should be placed as far apart as possible.
 * Preference to be given to people who would like to avoid dogs. See Example below
 * Desks are arranged in a single line of adjacent desks.
 * Teams sit next to each other, so the team boundary must be taken into account.
 *
 * For example, if given a single team of 5 people with the following preferences:
 * 1. Alice - likes dogs
 * 2. Bob - likes dogs
 * 3. Charlie - doesn't like dogs
 * 4. David - has a dog
 * 5. Eve - has a dog
 *
 * A valid desk layout would be:
 * Charlie(Avoid), Alice(Like), David(Has), Bob(Like), Eve(Has)
 *
 * If Bob left, then a new valid desk layout would be
 * Charlie(Avoid), Alice(Like), David(Has), Eve(Has)
 *
 * There is a test suite provided that is disabled in calculateDeskLayout.spec.ts
 * This test suite may not be exhaustive for all edge cases.
